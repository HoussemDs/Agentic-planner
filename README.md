# Project Planner
![Project Planner](data/project%20planner.png)

## Overview
The Project Planner tool helps you efficiently plan, track, and manage your projects. By simply providing a description of your project, including goals, requirements, and team members, the tool generates a comprehensive plan with tasks, milestones, and team assignments. The result is a structured, organized project that you can easily follow and track.



## Features
### What This Project Does
This project streamlines project management by automating the creation of a detailed project plan. You can input the following information:

- Project Type

- Project Objectives

- Team Members

- Project Requirements

From this, the project will generate:

- *Tasks*: A list of actions, their details, and team assignments.

- *Milestones*: Key events or goals to track project progress.

#### Generated Output
After you provide the project description, the tool creates two CSV files:

`tasks.csv`
Contains task names, descriptions, assignees .... .
![tasks](data/task.png)


`milestones.csv`
Contains milestones with their details, deadlines, and responsible team members.

![milestones](data/milestones.png)

These files help keep track of each aspect of the project, from daily tasks to major milestones.

## Configuration and Personalization
The system uses a config file that contains task and agent configurations (e.g., team members, roles). You can easily personalize task details using Pydantic.

- Personalizing the task information will automatically update the generated CSV files.

- No need to manually modify the CSVs; the tool handles the changes based on your preferences.
