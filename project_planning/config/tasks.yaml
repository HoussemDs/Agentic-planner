task_breakdown:
  description: |
      Carefully analyze the project_requirements for the {project_type}
      project and break them down into individual tasks. Define each
      task's scope in detail, set achievable timelines, and ensure that
      all dependencies are accounted for:

      {project_requirements}

      Team members:

      {team_members}
  expected_output: |
      A comprehensive list of tasks with detailed descriptions, timelines,
      dependencies, and deliverables. Your final output MUST include a
      Gantt chart or similar timeline visualization specific to the
      {project_type} project.

time_resource_estimation:
  description: |
      Thoroughly evaluate each task in the {project_type} project to
      estimate the time, resources, and effort required.
      Use historical data, task complexity, and available resources to
      provide a realistic estimation for each task.
  expected_output: |
      A detailed estimation report outlining the time, resources, and
      effort required for each task in the {project_type} project.
      Your final report MUST include a summary of any risks or
      uncertainties associated with the estimations.

resource_allocation:
  description: |
      Strategically allocate tasks for the {project_type} project to
      team members based on their skills, availability, and current
      workload. Ensure that each task is assigned to the most suitable
      person to maximize productivity and avoid bottlenecks.
  expected_output: |
      A structured ProjectPlan object including:
      - A list of TaskEstimate items, each with the task name, estimated
        time in hours, and the required resources.
      - A list of Milestone objects defining key milestones and
        their associated task names.
      This output must be valid according to the ProjectPlan schema and
      should ensure that resource allocation decisions are clear,
      justified, and optimized for team performance.
